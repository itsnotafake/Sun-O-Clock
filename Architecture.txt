Architecture:

WEARABLE:
-onCreate fires a message to the mobile side.
-A message will be returned entailing the current weather data. Using this message's notification, we draw the background and temperature values on the watch face.
-Implement OnDataChanged to update the watchface.

MOBILE:
-receives a message from wearable (on wearable's startup/create).
-message starts a service that 1. Immediately sends the wearable current weather data 2. Enables Data Items, syncing the two's weather data
